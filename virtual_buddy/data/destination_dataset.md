## How to Get a SIM Card in India

They change the rules on how to get a SIM card in India often, but as of now, you can get one as a foreigner as long as you have an address to list.

What You Need to Get a SIM Card
An Unlocked Phone
First, you need a phone with a SIM slot. Pretty much all phones have at least one these days. In fact, if you’re due for a new phone, check out Android options as they often have 2 SIM card slots vs. Apple’s one. This means you can keep your original SIM card in with your Whatsapp and usual apps going whilst putting the new Indian SIM in the second slot and using the data from this SIM card to run the phone.

An important point to note, even if you have one or two SIM card slots, your phone needs to be unlocked. In many places this is automatic, but check with your phone company first. Last we checked, US phones don’t come unlocked unless you purposely buy one that way.

If You Can’t Unlock Your Phone
The easiest option is to look into Trabug (more on that below), but you can also buy phones in India on Amazon.in and they can be delivered to your hotel/hostel within a few days.

There are phone brands on Amazon called Oppo, Redmi, Xiaomi, Infinux – all relatively cheap and good quality phones. Have a look before you start your trip to see whether it is better to buy it before your trip in your home country or in India once arrived.

2×2 Photograph & Passport Copy
In order to apply to get a SIM card, you need a copy of your passport, a 2x2inch photograph, and, of course, there will be paperwork at the shop you buy it.

## Fare Guide

The cost of traveling via auto-rickshaw (also known as "auto" or "tuk-tuk") in India can vary based on several factors such as the city, time of day, and negotiations with the driver. However, I can provide you with a rough estimate based on common rates in Indian cities:

For 5km: This distance might cost you around ₹100 to ₹150, depending on the city and other factors.
For 10km: Expect to pay around ₹150 to ₹250.
For 15km: You might need to pay approximately ₹250 to ₹350.
For 20km: The fare could range from ₹350 to ₹450.
These are just estimates, and actual prices can vary. It's also common to negotiate the fare with the auto driver before starting the journey, especially for longer distances.

The cost of traveling by taxi in India can also vary depending on factors such as the city, type of taxi (such as regular taxi, app-based cab services like Uber or Ola, or premium taxis), time of day, and traffic conditions. Here's a rough estimate of taxi fares for the distances you mentioned:

For 5km: Expect to pay around ₹100 to ₹200, depending on the city and type of taxi.
For 10km: The fare might range from ₹200 to ₹400.
For 15km: You could be looking at approximately ₹300 to ₹600.
For 20km: The fare could vary from ₹400 to ₹800.
Again, these are rough estimates, and actual fares can differ based on various factors. It's advisable to check with local taxi services or apps for more accurate pricing information for your specific location and requirements.
